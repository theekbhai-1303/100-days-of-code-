# 100-days-of-code-
i will be trying to learn  DSA through this 100 days of code method where i will be aiming to practise 2 questions daily and learning new concepts 
The aim is to understand DSA 
It would be my first step towards committing completely towards coding and building up a habbit 
Would love people to connect with me if they want to do partner coding
